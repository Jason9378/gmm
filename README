  NAME:
    gmm.h

  PURPOSE:
    A class that implements a 1-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Model fit with the EM algorithm

  PLATFORM:
    Tested in 2013 on a MacPro running OSX 10.8.2, but it should be platform independent as long as GSL is available.
  
  DEPENDENCIES:
    Requires GNU GSL, which can be found at <http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>.
    When compiling, use the flags 
      -lgsl -lgslcblas 
    or 
      $(LIB_PATH)/libgsl.a $(LIB_PATH)/libgslcblas.a

  USAGE:
    The class object contains all the machinery to do a GMM estimation with the EM algorithm.
    Upon instantiation, GMM will require the following:
    
      n : number of Gaussians to use

      a : array of initial guesses for the mixture coefficients

      mean :  array of intial guesses for the means

      var :  array of initial guesses for the variances

    Optional parameters:

      maxIter : maximum number of iterations of the EM algorithm, default 250
      
      p : desired precision stopping condition, default 1e-5
      
      v : if true, will output progress of each step of EM algorithm, default true

    To run the EM algorithm, call GMM::estimate(double *data, int dataSize)

    Example:
    
      GMM gmm(n,a,mean,var);
      gmm.estimate(data,dataSize);
